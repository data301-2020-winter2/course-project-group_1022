## Project Milestone 2 - Task 5 : Analysis ##

*Research Question:* how does an increase in completed cases reflect upon median wait time?

Each of the analysis conducted will be based off the EDA's conducted by each member of the group. A total of **three analyses** will be made.

**Analysis 1 :** Based off of Akshaj's EDA Analsyis
Accordin

**Analysis 2 :** Based off of Monica's EDA Analysis
According to Monica's graph of "Year End Patient Surgeries Completed vs Patients Waiting by Health Authority" it seems that a smaller amount of surgeries completed correlated to a smaller amount of patients waiting. This could mean that hospitals and other care facilities were able to handle the load of operations and increase productivity to get through more of the surgeries. The higher number of surgeries that need to take place could mean that the hospitals are over-exercising their resources and capabilities and are falling short of getting through as many patients as possible to keep the number of patients waiting down.

**Analysis 3 :** Based off of Rynelle's EDA Analysis
According to Rynelle's graphs, it is similar to the other team members analysis in which it seems that each health authority has different capabilities in terms of the amount of surgeries they can handle an preform. A smaller amount of annual surgeries have lead to a lower number of waiting patients, while the opposite is also true. This is seems to be logical as each hospital has a certain limit that caps it's operations, resources, and abilities. The sheer number of surgeries that must be performed will always leave patients waiting simply due to their parameters.
