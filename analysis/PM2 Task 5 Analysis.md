## Project Milestone 2 - Task 5 : Analysis ##

*Research Question:* how does an increase in completed cases reflect upon median wait time?

Each of the analysis conducted will be based off the EDA's conducted by each member of the group. A total of **three analyses** will be made.

**Analysis 1 :** Based off of Akshaj's EDA Analsyis
Accordin

**Analysis 2 :** Based off of Monica's EDA Analysis
According to Monica's graph of "Year End Patient Surgeries Completed to Patients Waiting by Health Authority" it seems that a smaller amount of surgeries completed correlated to a smaller amount of patients waiting. This could mean that hospitals and other care facilities were able to handle the load of operations and increase productivity to get through more of the surgeries. The higher number of surgeries that need to take place could mean that the hospitals are over-excerising their resources and capabilities and are falling short of getting through as many patients as possible to keep the number of patients waiting down.
