1) Uploaded CSV file to Jupyter Lab
2) Used Pandas to bring data into Notebook
March 5
Unfortunately a work crisis required my energies and attention last week so I am coming to milestone 2 a little behind.  I sense from others in the class that I am not the only one.  I completed the exercises for Git Branching.  I still need a bit of help with the final exercise (remote#8).
March 6
I created a playing_In_Markdown file and **played** around with *markdown* elements.
I started doing simply practice techniques on our dataframe.  I am not sure if it is because classes are on line but I find I am quite confused about where I am supposed to be finding the information I need to complete the steps of milestone 2.  It all looks a little like greek to me.  Honestly, this is where my lack of computer know how presents a challenge.  I have carefully reviewed all of the requirements for lab5 and M2, maybe the fog is clearing

I have decided to go back and review all the python notes and videos provided in class to orient myself. After hours and hours of reviewing the class information I now feel oriented enough to really start working on the dataset.
March 9
Continuing work on orienting myself to the data set.  I am finding this project a bit like wanting to go on a vacation to the Bahamas....I know where I want to go, which direction to fly and for how long, I know what I will do when I get there, shuttle and hotel are arranged, now I just have to learn how to fly the dang plane!!!  I know what the data set means.  I know what I want to include/exclude and what questions I can ask of it, I am just really having to work at figuring out how to use the tools...it is immensely slow and frustrating, but I am starting to get it.
March 10
Started some basic visualization of the data.  Realized we need to separate the All categories from the rest of the data....duplicates!
March 11
Continued work on my EDA
Figured out how to remove our duplicate summation data....the "All" categories were pooled data for the other values...sorted them out.  Thankfully, Akshaj is a whiz at the chaining and changing the single commands into functions. I suspect Rynelle will be our writing super star.  
March 12
Completed Lab 5 so now I know how to use the visualization tools for our data.
Waiting for Akshaj and Rynelle to complete their EDA so we can pull together our write up for Task 5.
