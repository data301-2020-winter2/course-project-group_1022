March 5
1) Completed the exercises for Git Branching.  
2) Still need a bit of help with the final exercise (remote#8).
March 6
1) Created a playing_In_Markdown file and **played** around with *markdown* elements.
2) Started doing simply practice techniques on our dataframe.  I am not sure if it is because classes are on line but I find I am quite confused about where I am supposed to be finding the information I need to complete the steps of milestone 2.  It all looks a little like greek to me.  Honestly, this is where my lack of computer know how presents a challenge.  
3) Reviewed all of the requirements for lab5 and M2, maybe the fog is clearing. 
March 7
1) Went back to review all the python notes and videos provided in class to orient myself.
2) Started working on the dataset.
March 9
1) Continuing work on orienting myself to the data set.  I am finding this project a bit like wanting to go on a vacation to the Bahamas....I know where I want to go, which direction to fly and for how long, I know what I will do when I get there, shuttle and hotel are arranged, now I just have to learn how to fly the dang plane!!!  I know what the data set means.  I know what I want to include/exclude and what questions I can ask of it, I am just really having to work at figuring out how to use the tools...it is immensely slow and frustrating, but I am starting to get it.
March 10
1) Started some basic visualization of the data.  
2) Realized we need to separate the All categories from the rest of the data....duplicates!
March 11
1) Continued work on my EDA.
2) Figured out how to remove our duplicate summation data....the "All" categories were pooled data for the other values...sorted them out.   
March 12
1) Completed Lab 5 so now I know how to use the visualization tools for our data.
2) Waiting for Akshaj and Rynelle to complete their EDA so we can pull our write up together for Task 5.
