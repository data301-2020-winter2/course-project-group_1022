**###Increasing surgeries to reduce surgical waiting lists and patient wait times in British Columbia###**

*Waiting for elective surgery has been shown to negatively impact patients, health systems and society on many levels.*  From the societal economic impacts through increased patient depression, disability and mortality, it has been repeatedly shown that having patients waiting for surgery has many deleterious consequences for all (1,2,3).  Monitoring surgical waitlists and patient wait times are key markers used to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of health systems in British Columbia and worldwide (4,5,6). Minimizing surgical waitlists and waittimes is deemed an important factor in keeping individuals and populations healthy and productive. 
On May 7th, 2020 the province of BC released "A Commitment to Surgical Renewal in BC" plan(7).  This was identified as an ["ambitous"](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-bc-plans-ambitious-fix-of-surgical-wait-list-backlog-while-still/) plan to reduce surgical waitlists especially after the province-wide shutdown that occurred in the first stages of the Covid-19 pandemic.  As outlined in the renewal plan the first key step to reducing surgical waits is to increase the number of surgeries performed across the province(8). On the surface this seems like a logical strategy but does increasing the number of surgeries completed in British Columbia reduce the number of people on the surgical waitlist and has it been shown that completing more surgeries correlates with a reduction in the time patients must wait for surgery. 
Through analysis of the 2009-2020 Annual Surgical Wait Times database (9) we will endeavour to answer these two important questions.
