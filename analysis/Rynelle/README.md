## Rynelle's Project Log ##

*12 February 2021*
1. Having difficulty with program; jupyter lab, terminal
2. Have created a directory (Task 1) with a 'README' file

*9 March 2021*
1. Took a step away from the project, but have now come back for the **PM2 due date**
2. Currently, I am trying to read through the tasks for PM2 just so I can understand what is going on. I definitely **struggle** with this class; just figuring what I'm supposed to do and how to string functions together; so I want to make sure I am understanding what is being asked of us
3. I also took Monica's idea of creating a **blank markdown** to keep helpful notes, practice, and other things that will help me complete the project
4. I am definitely **stressed out** but feeling confident that we'll get it done and I won't dragmy group down

5. Task 4: Find an EDA; must use two columns of data, have three visuals, and notes/commentary
6. Task 5: Using the EDA, answer the research questions propsed. Use visuals and commentary. (can change questions if need be)

*12 March 2021*
1. Have been attempting to work on PM2 but it has been going well
2. A huge **struggle** because it keeps saying my file can not be found
3. I am currently working on Task 5 before moving to Task 4

*22 March 2021*
1. Began looking at PM3 to see what the criteria entailed
2. Divided up the work between members
3. Seems like a relatively easy milestone, but it's a good set up for the final project

*29 March 2021*
1. We have been having some **complications** with Akshaj's push/pull
2. Monica and I are trying to see what the problem is
3. Last restort, one of us will input his work for him

*4 April 2021*
1. We have begun working on **Lab 7** as a group
2. Monica will be looking at wait-times vs procedure at specific hospitals while I will be looking at waitlists vs procedures across Health Authorities
3. We have decided to work on Lab 7 as a group to make it easier but to also prep for **PM4**

*7 April 2021*
1. We figured out Lab 7 and have begun getting everything together
2. There was **a lot** of information we could compare, but we stuck to our original analyses

*10 April 2021*
1. We were **finally** able to submit Lab 7
2. Towards the end of Lab 7, we decided to also put together PM4
3. We're excited about getting this done and seeing where our work has taken us

*13 April 2021*
1. Got myself up and ready to finish off this project
2. We finally got it all done, although getting the timing was really difficult
3. Really happy and proud with the group's work and relieved we are **finally** done
