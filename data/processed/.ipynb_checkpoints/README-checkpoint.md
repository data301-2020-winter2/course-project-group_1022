We created cleaned and wrangled csv files in preparation for visualization with Tableau. Our initial dataset has duplicate summary numerical data. We created multiple csv files to ensure that we do not have duplicate values in any dataset but still have the opportunity to visualize and analyze the summary values and the basic values while working in Tableau.
***
The csv files in this folder are as follows:
1) basic = specific procedure by specific hospitals ->This would be the raw information and we can use it to tease out exactly what cases are done at specific hospitals, or converse for a specific hospitals which cases are they completing and which do they have waiting. 
2) ha = specific procedure by "All facilities" within each specific health authority ->This would be helpful to compare regional rates of surgical completions and wait data.
3) hosp_all_prcd = summary of "All Procedures" by specific hospitals. ->This would be a metric for how each hospital is performing overall.
4) prcd = specific procedures by "All Health Authorities" -> This would highlight the provincial rates of completion and wait data for each specific procedure.
5) summary = "All Procedures"  by "All Health Authorities" -> This would hightlight general trends across the province in overall completions and waits.
